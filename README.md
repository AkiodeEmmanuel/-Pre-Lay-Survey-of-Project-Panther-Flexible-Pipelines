# -Pre-Lay-Survey-of-Project-Panther-Flexible-Pipelines
## Malu 23 – Malu Jkt 19, Malu 23 to OPOBO PP, Mejo 2 to EWAN PP  

## Project Overview  
The Pre-Lay Survey was conducted to ensure the readiness of the seabed for the installation of flexible pipelines along the specified routes. The survey aimed to identify potential obstacles, evaluate subsurface conditions, and provide detailed geospatial data for pipeline route planning and installation.  

## Project Details  
- **Date:** January 2024 – February 2024  
- **Role:** Lead Surveyor  
- **Client:** Chevron Nigeria Limited  
- **Vessel:** MC CELTIC ZION
- **Project Location**: Chevron Field

## Responsibilities  
- Collaborated with the client and Project Manager to define the survey scope, objectives, and deliverables, ensuring alignment with project requirements.  
-  Calibrated and tested all survey equipment, ensuring they were in optimal condition for deployment.  
-  Organized and briefed the survey team, assigning tasks and responsibilities to optimize efficiency and achieve project goals.  
-  Carryout depth measurement using the single beam echosounder (Echotrac) to collect accurate depth data.  
-  Deployed the side scan sonar to capture high-resolution images of the seabed, identifying obstacles, debris, and key seabed features.  
-  Used the Magnetometer (G882) to detect ferrous objects, ensuring the planned pipeline route was clear of obstructions.  
-   Employed the sub-bottom profiler (Edgetech) to investigate subsurface conditions, detecting buried objects and sediment layers to assess the seabed’s stability.  
-   Monitored survey operations in real-time using **EIVA NaviPac**, ensuring all data collection processes were aligned with project objectives.
-   Continuously assessed data quality, making necessary real-time adjustments to equipment and methodologies to ensure accurate results.  
-   Provided regular updates to the client, including preliminary findings and addressing any project-specific queries or concerns.  

## Equipment/Software Used  
- **EIVA NaviPac, NaviEdit, Navimodel:** For real-time navigation, post-processing, and 3D modeling of survey data.  
- **Hypack 2018, Sonawiz 6:** Used for data acquisition and analysis.  
- **AutoCAD:** For creating detailed survey maps and visualizing pipeline routes.  
- **C-Nav DGPS:** High-precision positioning system for surface navigation.  
- **TSS Meridian Gyro:** Ensured accurate vessel orientation and heading.  
- **Single Beam Echosounder (Echotrac):** Used for bathymetric data collection.  
- **Side Scan Sonar:** Provided high-resolution imaging of the seabed.  
- **Magnetometer (G882):** Detected ferrous objects and aided route clearance.  
- **Sub-bottom Profiler (Edgetech):** Investigated subsurface conditions.  
- **Total Station:** Facilitated accurate measurements and positioning.  
- **DMS Motion Sensor:** Corrected for vessel motion during data acquisition.  
- **Valeport SVP MIDAS:** Measured sound velocity profiles for depth corrections.  

## Outcome  
The survey delivered detailed bathymetric maps, seabed imagery, and subsurface analysis, enabling the client to proceed with pipeline installation confidently. Potential risks and obstacles were identified and mitigated, ensuring the project adhered to safety and efficiency standards.
